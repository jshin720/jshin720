# üí´ About Me:
I am a self-driven problem solver, that loves to learn new skills and apply them in creative ways. I love to code; building everything from small scripts to automate processes to large-scale web application projects. I have experience in building applications with React.js, Redux JavaScript, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, and HTML/CSS.<br><br>With years of experience in real estate, I have strengthened my work ethic, ability to work on a team, and my problem-solving skills. Every new deal in real estate comes with new challenges and situations and because of that, I had to always be ready to learn skills when the need arises. As such, I am confident that with my technical expertise coupled with my wide variety of experiences, I can hit the ground running.<br>
